        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prep the chicken. Pat dry each chicken thigh with a paper towel completely before adding seasoning. This helps create extra crispy skins when searing. Add olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix well with a spoon to combine. Generously smear the seasoning mixture all over the chicken thighs, on both sides (using disposable gloves helps make clean up easier).
            </li>
            <li>
                Sear the chicken. Heat the remaining olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium high heat for 2 minutes until the oil starts to sizzle and shimmer. Place the chicken thighs with the skin side down on the skillet, and sear for 2 minutes until the skin turns brown and crispy. Flip the chicken over and cook on the other side for another 2 minutes. Remove the chicken thighs from the skillet and place them on a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sauté vegetables. On the same skillet, add chopped onions, garlic, grated apple and paprika, and stir well to combine. Cook for 2 minutes until fragrant. You should notice the onions and garlic start browning. Add in potatoes and carrots. Stir well with a spatula to combine. Add in Dijon mustard and soy sauce. Mix well to coat the mixture evenly with seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Simmer. Place the chicken thighs on top of the vegetable mixture, with the skin side facing up. Add 2 cups of water (the liquid mixture should cover about ⅓ of the chicken thighs in height). Bring the mixture to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake. Transfer the skillet into the preheated 450 F oven and bake for 35 minutes, until the internal temperature for the chicken thighs reaches 165F. The liquid mixture should thicken nicely. Remove the skillet from the oven and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. If the liquid has not thickened enough and it is still too watery, place the skillet back on the stove and bring to a simmer for another 10 minutes, or until desired consistency is reached.
            </li>
